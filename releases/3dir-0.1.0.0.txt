This is 3Dir: an extension that dynamically moves/renames your downloads to directories according to your specified criteria.

This is a pre-alpha release. It only does 1 thing:
- always moves your download to a folder named the same as the domain name of download's URL

This has been tested for normal binary downloads and for webpages downloaded using the "Save Page WE" Chrome extension. CTRL+S behavior is not overridden.

Feedback is welcome: do it at the project's GitHub page (click Website ->).
